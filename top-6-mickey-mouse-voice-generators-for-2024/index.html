<p>Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Voicemod on your Windows 7&#x2F;10&#x2F;11 PC or Mac computer and run it.</p>
<p><strong><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="install and run voicemod ai"
                ></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-2.jpg"
                      alt="enter sound settings on voicemod ai"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Ensure that the <strong>Voice Changer</strong> toggle at the bottom of the Voicemod home window is enabled. Then, click the <strong>Voicebox</strong> tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose a voice effect on voicemod ai"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If the voice is working, head to the application or browser tab where you want to apply the voice effect to start streaming. That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.</p>
