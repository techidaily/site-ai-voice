How real time AI voice changers work</strong></h2><p>A <strong>real time voice changer AI</strong> is a program that has been extensively trained using deep machine learning algorithms to create a virtual clone of human voices. These programs work by creating a large data set of diverse audio clips, allowing them to analyze your live voice and transform it into your input prompt.</p>
<p>Usually, AI voice changers use machine learning algorithms to transform live voices recorded using your microphone easily. However, sometimes, you may need to enter a text data prompt using speech-to-text AI voice cloning services. Whichever model you choose, the speech training model can take a few minutes or hours to clone your voice.</p>

For example, you can make sound adjustments like pitch, tone, emotion, etc. Overall, the AI voice cloning process is pretty complex, although the process on your side may take just a few clicks.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Next, enter the text script that you want to convert to audio. You can enter up to 2,000 characters.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adjust language and settings on wondershare virbo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the audio output language. This program supports English, Spanish, Hindi, and other languages. Now change the audio speed, pitch, and volume. You can also add background music, image templates, and subtitles.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Lastly, preview your video before exporting to 720p or 1080p. That’s it!</p>
