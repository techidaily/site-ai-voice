<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Voicemod on your Windows 7&#x2F;10&#x2F;11 PC or Mac computer and run it.</p>
<p><strong><img

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.</p>
<p><img

Then, click the <strong>Voicebox</strong> tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.</p>
