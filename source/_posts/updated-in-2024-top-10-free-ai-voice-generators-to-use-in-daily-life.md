Voice cloning is a procedure in which a program generates an identical voice of a real person through speech synthesis. This technology uses deep learning strategies and AI to replicate a human voice through audio recordings. To clone a voice, there are several **voice cloning apps** comprising distinctive properties.

The voice cloning software analyzes the speech patterns, pitch, tone, and other vocal properties of the targeted human. Voice cloning has various uses in businesses and media industries.

## Part 2: How a Voice Cloning Works to Clone a Voice Efficiently

Voice cloning technology uses a structured procedure to bring accurate results. The first step is to collect the data from the targeted audio recordings. The audio recordings include the speech of a particular person with different phrases and contexts. Afterward, the program extracts the distinctive features of the person’s voice. The features include voice tone, pitch, rhythm, intonation, and other properties.

After collecting the data, the AI technology creates a training dataset. This dataset includes the input text and audio recordings of the individual. Then AI technology learns to match the input text to audio recordings. Now, the program uses a neural network as a deep learning technique to clone a voice.
