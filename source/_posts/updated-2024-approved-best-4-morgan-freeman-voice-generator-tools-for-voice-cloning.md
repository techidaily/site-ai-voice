## **Part 1\. Who is Eminem and What Does He Do?**

Eminem (Marshall Bruce Mathers III) will feature highly on the list when mentioning legendary musicians. Eminem is an American-born rapper born in 1972\. He is credited for helping popularize hip-hop and is among the best-selling rappers of the 20th and 21st centuries. It's estimated that Eminem has worldwide sales of over 220 million records and was the best-selling musician in the US in the early 2000s.

That said, Eminem has one of the most unique voices in the music industry. The rapper has managed to change his voice with ease over the years. He is comfortable with low notes and can efficiently ascend as high as possible. Interestingly, David Guetta recently revealed that he used an **AI voice generator for Eminem** to replicate the rapper's voice. This shows just how much AI technology is touching on multiple industries.
