The thing is that Voicemod comes with special features that can make your voice stand out in the group. Also, this tool is designed to give you a seamless voice-changing session. Let’s look at some of its shining points!

### 1\. Real-time voice modulator

Voicemod allows you to process voices in real-time, making it the ideal software for streaming on Twitch or making fun calls on Zoom. The AI voice generator has been extensively trained by voices from professional actors to give you human-like narrations. You only need to connect your mic to stream content with **Voicemod AI voice**. We’ll show you how to do that in this guidepost.

### 2\. Extensive variety of voice effects

Voicemod comes with more than 100 voice effects, with this voice-changing software adding more voices with new updates. The massive library of voice effects and sound modification features means you’ll get unlimited experience with Voicemod. It’s one of the few programs that allows you to modify your voices with reverb, pitch, chorus, vocoder, and other customization features.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:
