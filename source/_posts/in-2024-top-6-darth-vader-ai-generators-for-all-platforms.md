It's important to pronounce words correctly, especially when using technical or industry-specific terminology. Look for a voice generator that can pronounce words and phrases correctly and has an extensive pronunciation dictionary. Some voice generators also enable you to modify the pronunciation and allow you to adjust your generated sound according to your particular requirements.

Spoken language needs to use emphasis and intonation to express the emotions, meaning, and context of a statement.

Both factors help the narrator's voice generator effectively deliver the information. The narrator's voice generator must be able to modify intonation and emphasis to provide natural speech.

Voice generators are widely used by both people and businesses to generate sound files for many kinds of commercial uses, including marketing and advertising, e-learning, and training.
