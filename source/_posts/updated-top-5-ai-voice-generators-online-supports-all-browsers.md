## **Part 1\. How real time AI voice changers work**

A **real time voice changer AI** is a program that has been extensively trained using deep machine learning algorithms to create a virtual clone of human voices.

Whichever model you choose, the speech training model can take a few minutes or hours to clone your voice.

But AI voice cloners don’t work independently. Instead, these tools allow you to make post-processing adjustments to make your AI voice sound how you want it. For example, you can make sound adjustments like pitch, tone, emotion, etc. Overall, the AI voice cloning process is pretty complex, although the process on your side may take just a few clicks.

AI (Artificial Intelligence) has become part and parcel of our lives these days. Communication is one of the industries that this revolutionary technology has dramatically impacted. Nowadays, you can harness the power of AI to create professional videos and audio narrations to pass your message effectively. So, in this post, we will help you find the best **real time AI voice changer** and some possible uses for this program. Let’s dig in!

## **Part 1\. How real time AI voice changers work**

A **real time voice changer AI** is a program that has been extensively trained using deep machine learning algorithms to create a virtual clone of human voices. These programs work by creating a large data set of diverse audio clips, allowing them to analyze your live voice and transform it into your input prompt.

Usually, AI voice changers use machine learning algorithms to transform live voices recorded using your microphone easily. However, sometimes, you may need to enter a text data prompt using speech-to-text AI voice cloning services. Whichever model you choose, the speech training model can take a few minutes or hours to clone your voice.

But AI voice cloners don’t work independently. Instead, these tools allow you to make post-processing adjustments to make your AI voice sound how you want it. For example, you can make sound adjustments like pitch, tone, emotion, etc. Overall, the AI voice cloning process is pretty complex, although the process on your side may take just a few clicks.

## **Part 2\. Popular applications of real-time AI voice changers**

As said at the beginning, AI has been a vital cog in our lives for a while. Today, you can use an **AI voice changer real time** in multiple industries, including entertainment, communication, accessibility, and more. Let’s briefly overview how to use a real-time AI voice cloning app.

#### 1\. Entertainment industry

Voice changers are now widespread in the movie and gaming industries. This tool can clone your voice to sound like your favorite gaming character or celebrity. For instance, you can use voice modulation software to sound like a monster in a gaming scene and make the whole experience more immersive.

#### 2\. Communication and privacy

Using an avatar profile picture or a fake photo isn’t the only way to maintain privacy while gaming online or creating content. With a real time AI voice changer, you can clone your voice online to sound like Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Will Smith, and other celebrities. Some AI voice changers also have voices that are ideal for video documentaries.

#### 3\. Accessibility

Did you know that non-native speakers create some of the videos and audio you find online? We have AI to thank for that! This technology allows people to create unique content in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and other languages. Besides breaking language barriers, AI allows people with speech disabilities to create online content using speech-to-text converters.
