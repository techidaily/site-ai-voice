## Part 1\. Understanding Robot Voice Generation Technology

A robot voice generator is simply a tool you can use to generate artificial voice. Why do you need one? You may have the need of a robot voice generator or AI voice generator for any reason. TTS or Text-To-Speech software always suffered from a singular problem – the voices always sounded robotic, hence the name robot voice generator. But we are living in the age of AI, and today, we have AI voice generators that can bridge that divide and bring to you life-like, expressive voiceovers that you would not be able to tell from a real human voice!

You can use these artificially created voices to read your text anywhere, especially today when video content rules the roost. You can use these voices to read documents and presentations and what not, for yourself, or for other people who may want to listen to the text. However, with AI voice generators, you can have even more uses for a **robot voice generator**, such as providing customer support to users through virtual assistants. You do not have to keep a human professional to take the calls, you could have 5 different virtual agents with 5 different voices generated using AI voice generators to make your business look larger than it is and serve more clients at once! The possibilities are endless!

## Part 2\. Best 10 Robot Voice Generators

Thanks to the AI, large quantities of voice samples and specialized equipment are no longer needed for voice cloning. The ability to replicate any kind of voice has become a lot easier thanks to recent advancements in AI and voice synthesis technologies. Today, we employ AI-generated voices often in video games, branding, animation film voice acting, voice assistants, audiobooks, etc.
