Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

The thing is that Voicemod comes with special features that can make your voice stand out in the group. Also, this tool is designed to give you a seamless voice-changing session. Let’s look at some of its shining points!

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Extensive variety of voice effects

Voicemod comes with more than 100 voice effects, with this voice-changing software adding more voices with new updates. The massive library of voice effects and sound modification features means you’ll get unlimited experience with Voicemod. It’s one of the few programs that allows you to modify your voices with reverb, pitch, chorus, vocoder, and other customization features.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices. With it, you can create voices from scratch by combining different audio effects and processors like reverb, pitch shifter, filter, and more. Once you have made a custom voice, proceed to name it, add an avatar, and add it to the voice control panel. This is an excellent way to create unique voices you cannot find anywhere else.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:

**Step 1\.** Install Voicemod on your Windows 7/10/11 PC or Mac computer and run it.

**![install and run voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-1.jpg)**

**Step 2\.** Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.

![enter sound settings on voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-2.jpg)

**Step 3.** Ensure that the **Voice Changer** toggle at the bottom of the Voicemod home window is enabled. Then, click the **Voicebox** tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.

![choose a voice effect on voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-3.jpg)

**Step 4.** If the voice is working, head to the application or browser tab where you want to apply the voice effect to start streaming. That’s it!

**Note:** Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.

## Part III. Real User Experience

So, what was our user experience with **AI Voicemod**? To be honest, Voicemod is one of the best if not the best, voice modulator programs. We were impressed by how easily it picks up sounds on our microphone. The range of voice effects and customization options is also impressive, to say the least. And yes, the platform itself looks stylish and modern.

But this program’s main drawback comes from its major strength. Although Voicemod is a feature-rich program, beginners might feel intimidated at first. You may need to follow the developer’s guide to connect your microphone appropriately and customize the sound settings. Overall, Voicemod isn’t for green hands, although it’s fun to use once you get the hang of it.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices. With it, you can create voices from scratch by combining different audio effects and processors like reverb, pitch shifter, filter, and more. Once you have made a custom voice, proceed to name it, add an avatar, and add it to the voice control panel. This is an excellent way to create unique voices you cannot find anywhere else.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:

**Step 1\.** Install Voicemod on your Windows 7/10/11 PC or Mac computer and run it.

**![install and run voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-1.jpg)**

**Step 2\.** Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.

**Step 3.** Ensure that the **Voice Changer** toggle at the bottom of the Voicemod home window is enabled. Then, click the **Voicebox** tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.

**Step 4.** If the voice is working, head to the application or browser tab where you want to apply the voice effect to start streaming. That’s it!

**Note:** Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.

## Part III. Real User Experience

So, what was our user experience with **AI Voicemod**? To be honest, Voicemod is one of the best if not the best, voice modulator programs. We were impressed by how easily it picks up sounds on our microphone. The range of voice effects and customization options is also impressive, to say the least. And yes, the platform itself looks stylish and modern.

But this program’s main drawback comes from its major strength. Although Voicemod is a feature-rich program, beginners might feel intimidated at first. You may need to follow the developer’s guide to connect your microphone appropriately and customize the sound settings. Overall, Voicemod isn’t for green hands, although it’s fun to use once you get the hang of it.

## Part IV. Pricing and Plans

Although Voicemod is free, you must upgrade to the Pro version to unlock all the voice effects and capabilities. Thankfully, the Voicemod subscription plan is one of the most competitive. You can opt for the One-Time Payment at **$59.00**, although the program often has **50% off** for new installations. You can also choose the Annual plan of **$23.88** or the 3-month plan of **$11.97**.

Below are some of the advantages you’ll get with Voicemod Pro:

* Design your unique voices from scratch with VoiceLab.
* Unlimited MP3 and WAV audio uploads.
* Complete Voicebox with 80+ pre-made voice effects.
* Receive new voices and themed soundboards every month.
* Unlock all AI voice filters.
