Voice cloning is a procedure in which a program generates an identical voice of a real person through speech synthesis. This technology uses deep learning strategies and AI to replicate a human voice through audio recordings. To clone a voice, there are several **voice cloning apps** comprising distinctive properties.

The voice cloning software analyzes the speech patterns, pitch, tone, and other vocal properties of the targeted human. Voice cloning has various uses in businesses and media industries. Due to its abundant usage, voice cloning apps bring constant powerful features. By using advanced voice cloning software, you can clone the voice of any individual with perfection.

## Part 2: How a Voice Cloning Works to Clone a Voice Efficiently

Voice cloning technology uses a structured procedure to bring accurate results. The first step is to collect the data from the targeted audio recordings. The audio recordings include the speech of a particular person with different phrases and contexts. Afterward, the program extracts the distinctive features of the person’s voice. The features include voice tone, pitch, rhythm, intonation, and other properties.

After collecting the data, the AI technology creates a training dataset. This dataset includes the input text and audio recordings of the individual. Then AI technology learns to match the input text to audio recordings. Now, the program uses a neural network as a deep learning technique to clone a voice. This network helps the model train through the input text and given vocal properties of the person’s voice.

Once the model gets trained, it generates a cloned voice by managing its internal parameters. Afterward, final adjustments and refinements are made to bring you the perfect output in the form of audio samples.

If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

#### 2.4: Pexels

Pexels was founded in Germany just about a decade ago in 2014 and has since grown to house over 3.2 million free stock photos and videos. The platform features over 411,000 talking photos for you to choose from. Pexels is part of Canva since 2018, just 4 years since its release. Must be doing something great, right?

#### 2.5: Pixabay

Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik
