So, where can you use the AI voices on this program? Voicemod is a pretty flexible program that allows you to achieve quite a lot. That’s because this program will modulate your voice in real-time, allowing you to shake things up on Discord group chats, Skype video calls, Steam gaming sessions, and other applications. You can even use it to create unique YouTube content and carve out your brand.

## Part II. Features and Capabilities

You must be asking yourself why we singled out Voicemod AI of all the AI voice modulation programs out there. The thing is that Voicemod comes with special features that can make your voice stand out in the group. Also, this tool is designed to give you a seamless voice-changing session. Let’s look at some of its shining points!

### 1\. Real-time voice modulator

Voicemod allows you to process voices in real-time, making it the ideal software for streaming on Twitch or making fun calls on Zoom. The AI voice generator has been extensively trained by voices from professional actors to give you human-like narrations. You only need to connect your mic to stream content with **Voicemod AI voice**. We’ll show you how to do that in this guidepost.

### 2\. Extensive variety of voice effects

Voicemod comes with more than 100 voice effects, with this voice-changing software adding more voices with new updates. The massive library of voice effects and sound modification features means you’ll get unlimited experience with Voicemod. It’s one of the few programs that allows you to modify your voices with reverb, pitch, chorus, vocoder, and other customization features.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices. With it, you can create voices from scratch by combining different audio effects and processors like reverb, pitch shifter, filter, and more. Once you have made a custom voice, proceed to name it, add an avatar, and add it to the voice control panel. This is an excellent way to create unique voices you cannot find anywhere else.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:

**Step 1\.** Install Voicemod on your Windows 7/10/11 PC or Mac computer and run it.

**![install and run voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-1.jpg)**

**Step 2\.** Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.

![enter sound settings on voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-2.jpg)

**Step 3.** Ensure that the **Voice Changer** toggle at the bottom of the Voicemod home window is enabled. Then, click the **Voicebox** tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.

![choose a voice effect on voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-3.jpg)

**Step 4.** If the voice is working, head to the application or browser tab where you want to apply the voice effect to start streaming. That’s it!

**Note:** Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.

## Part III. Real User Experience

So, what was our user experience with **AI Voicemod**? To be honest, Voicemod is one of the best if not the best, voice modulator programs. We were impressed by how easily it picks up sounds on our microphone. The range of voice effects and customization options is also impressive, to say the least. And yes, the platform itself looks stylish and modern.

But this program’s main drawback comes from its major strength. Although Voicemod is a feature-rich program, beginners might feel intimidated at first. You may need to follow the developer’s guide to connect your microphone appropriately and customize the sound settings. Overall, Voicemod isn’t for green hands, although it’s fun to use once you get the hang of it.

## Part IV. Pricing and Plans

Although Voicemod is free, you must upgrade to the Pro version to unlock all the voice effects and capabilities. Thankfully, the Voicemod subscription plan is one of the most competitive. You can opt for the One-Time Payment at **$59.00**, although the program often has **50% off** for new installations. You can also choose the Annual plan of **$23.88** or the 3-month plan of **$11.97**.

## Best Narrator Voice Generators

Having a fascinating and engaging voice is essential in the field of voiceover and narration. But not everybody has a suitable accent for narrating. A **narrator voice generator** might be beneficial in this situation. It is a very advanced piece of software that can convert words into a voice-over that sounds realistic, doing away with the need for a human narrator.

The narrator's voice generator can modify and control the voice qualities. Makers can change the artificial voice's pitch, speed, and tone to meet the demands of their production. The narrator's voice generator will probably play a crucial role for everyone involved in audio production.

## Part 1: Why do you need a narrator voice generator

Whether you need a deep, authoritative voice for media or a warm, welcoming tone for an e-learning module, a **narrator voice generator** may provide the ideal voice for the content. It will help you in the following ways:

It is also beneficial for tasks that have a limited amount of time and demand regular updates. The narrator's voice generator rapidly converts text into spoken words, saving the content makers a lot of time.

### **2\. Cost-Effectiveness**

When compared to voice actors, using a narrator voice generator may significantly decrease costs. Professional voice actors deliver customized narration of the highest caliber, but their services can be expensive, especially for projects requiring a lot of audio. While a narrator voice generator automates the translating of text process into voiceover, it provides a more affordable alternative.

### **3\. Multilingual Support**

It ensures that your material maintains a high level of professionalism and improves the user experience overall.

## Part 2: 5 Consideration for choosing a narrator voice generator

Your narrator's voice is essential for your audience to have an interesting and professional audio experience. We'll look into a few crucial considerations to keep in mind while choosing a **narrator voice generator**. The possibilities of using a narrator voice recorder are diverse, ranging from **storytelling voice generators** to **Google translate male voice generators**.

### **1\. Voice Quality and Naturalness**

An engaging and professional audio experience depends on the voice quality and naturalness of the generated voice. To select the voice that perfectly meets the requirements of your project, look for a voice generator that provides a variety of voice choices. It should be clear, with natural pronunciation and the right pitch and tone. Your listeners will be more likely to stay interested in your videos, lectures, or audiobooks if you have a natural voice.

### **2\. Multilingual Support**

If you are creating content in several languages or have an international audience, it's essential to pick a **narrator voice generator** with multilingual support. Check that the voice generator covers the languages you will be working with and that generated sounds seem natural in each language. A sense of reality is added to your project by keeping the availability of many accents within each language in mind.

### **3\. Pronunciation Accuracy**

It's important to pronounce words correctly, especially when using technical or industry-specific terminology. Look for a voice generator that can pronounce words and phrases correctly and has an extensive pronunciation dictionary. Some voice generators also enable you to modify the pronunciation and allow you to adjust your generated sound according to your particular requirements.

### **4\. Intonation and Emphasis**

Spoken language needs to use emphasis and intonation to express the emotions, meaning, and context of a statement. The rise and fall of the pitch during speech is intonation, and it is used to convey a variety of attitudes, feelings, and intentions. Both factors help the narrator's voice generator effectively deliver the information. The narrator's voice generator must be able to modify intonation and emphasis to provide natural speech.

### **5\. Commercial use**

Voice generators are widely used by both people and businesses to generate sound files for many kinds of commercial uses, including marketing and advertising, e-learning, and training. However, it's essential to be familiar with the narrator voice generator's license terms and conditions to ensure agreement to usage rights and intellectual property regulations.
