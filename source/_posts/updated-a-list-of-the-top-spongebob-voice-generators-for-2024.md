### 1\. Language Support

Creating video content that is consumable for a wider audience is crucial. That's why recent technologies embed features to create voices in all languages. Ensure the tool you choose can support the maximum languages in creating AI voices. Despite considering language support, verify the accurate pronunciation of words in that language.

### 2\. Customization Options

SpongeBob voice users need tailored voices according to their exclusive use cases. For this, the **AI voice generator SpongeBob** must contain customization options. In this regard, you should see if they can change the voice pitch, accent, and speed as required. You can also consider the variety in age and gender of SpongeBob's voice to align with your targeted audience.

### 3\. Accuracy and Expressiveness
