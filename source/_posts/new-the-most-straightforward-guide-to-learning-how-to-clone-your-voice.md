## **Part 2\. Reasons Why You Need Eminem AI Voice Generator?**

Throughout the past few years, more AI-generated content has been introduced in platforms like TikTok, Facebook Reels, YouTube, etc. Today, you can find multiple videos with smooth AI narration in almost any industry.

In January, Drayk.it made trending headlines after making Drake songs using AI.

With that in mind, below are some of the reasons why you should use an Eminem voice generator:

* Create custom phone and alarm ringtones.
* Narrate funny or motivational video stories with Eminem's voice.
* Practice singing by writing lyrics and finding out how the sentences flow.
