This technology can also be helpful with video narrations and gaming, where you don’t need to reveal your voice. But to achieve that, you must research the best voice modulation program. So, in this post, we want to introduce you to how to use **Voicemod AI voices** to sound differently on video games, VoIP apps, video narrations, and more.

With this program, you can sound almost like anything, including monsters, chipmunks, males, females, children, celebrities, and more. Even better, Voicemod has frequent updates with new AI voices.

So, where can you use the AI voices on this program? Voicemod is a pretty flexible program that allows you to achieve quite a lot. That’s because this program will modulate your voice in real-time, allowing you to shake things up on Discord group chats, Skype video calls, Steam gaming sessions, and other applications. You can even use it to create unique YouTube content and carve out your brand.

## Part II. Features and Capabilities

You must be asking yourself why we singled out Voicemod AI of all the AI voice modulation programs out there. The thing is that Voicemod comes with special features that can make your voice stand out in the group. Also, this tool is designed to give you a seamless voice-changing session. Let’s look at some of its shining points!

### 1\. Real-time voice modulator

Voicemod allows you to process voices in real-time, making it the ideal software for streaming on Twitch or making fun calls on Zoom. The AI voice generator has been extensively trained by voices from professional actors to give you human-like narrations. You only need to connect your mic to stream content with **Voicemod AI voice**. We’ll show you how to do that in this guidepost.

### 2\. Extensive variety of voice effects

Voicemod comes with more than 100 voice effects, with this voice-changing software adding more voices with new updates. The massive library of voice effects and sound modification features means you’ll get unlimited experience with Voicemod. It’s one of the few programs that allows you to modify your voices with reverb, pitch, chorus, vocoder, and other customization features.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices. With it, you can create voices from scratch by combining different audio effects and processors like reverb, pitch shifter, filter, and more. Once you have made a custom voice, proceed to name it, add an avatar, and add it to the voice control panel. This is an excellent way to create unique voices you cannot find anywhere else.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:

**Step 1\.** Install Voicemod on your Windows 7/10/11 PC or Mac computer and run it.

**![install and run voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-1.jpg)**

**Step 2\.** Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.
