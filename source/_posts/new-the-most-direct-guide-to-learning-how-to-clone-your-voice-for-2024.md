<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Language and Voice Support

Before selecting a [Hatsune Miku voice generator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/virbo/download/), you need to ensure that it supports a wide array of languages and voices. If a tool allows you to choose the tone and accent of an AI-generated voice, then it is also a wonderful thing.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Customizing Metrics

It can be problematic if you select a tool that comprehends no customizing metrics. It should let you convert, trim, and equalize the audio. You can also add breaks in the audio to maintain the humane touch.

### 3\. Formats of Audio

It is evident that not all people can work with MP3\. Sometimes, you have to work on other file formats, and eventually, you need to use a tool that is [compatible with versatile formats](https://virbo.wondershare.com/ai-voice.html). Thus, avoid selecting a tool that only works with a few numbered audio formats. This will save you from facing any restrictions and limitations.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Accuracy and Quality

The voice generator you are going to select should have the potential to create a voice that resembles **Hatsune Miku**. It should output a youthful tone that can engage more listeners. Some of the [Japanese phrases and words](https://virbo.wondershare.com/feature/translate-japanese-video.html) can be hard to pronounce. Thus, select a tool with powerful algorithms so it can pronounce the words correctly.
