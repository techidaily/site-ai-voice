## Part 2: Where Can You Download Talking Stock Photos For Free?

“Okay, I’m sold on talking photos! Where can I get them?”

Glad you asked! We have collated a repository of 6 portals that offer quality talking stock photos and talking stock images that you can choose and use!

**Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

What self-respecting journalist or newsreader does not know about Getty Images? Getty has a repertoire of over 7,935,000 high-quality talking photos for you to choose from. That all but guarantees that you will be able to find the ones you want and like.

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

#### 2.3: Unsplash

![unsplash talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-4.jpg)

Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

#### 2.4: Pexels

A robot voice generator is simply a tool you can use to generate artificial voice. Why do you need one? You may have the need of a robot voice generator or AI voice generator for any reason. TTS or Text-To-Speech software always suffered from a singular problem – the voices always sounded robotic, hence the name robot voice generator. But we are living in the age of AI, and today, we have AI voice generators that can bridge that divide and bring to you life-like, expressive voiceovers that you would not be able to tell from a real human voice!

You can use these artificially created voices to read your text anywhere, especially today when video content rules the roost. You can use these voices to read documents and presentations and what not, for yourself, or for other people who may want to listen to the text. However, with AI voice generators, you can have even more uses for a **robot voice generator**, such as providing customer support to users through virtual assistants. You do not have to keep a human professional to take the calls, you could have 5 different virtual agents with 5 different voices generated using AI voice generators to make your business look larger than it is and serve more clients at once! The possibilities are endless!

## **Part 1\. Why do you need AI voice changers?**

First, let’s start by listing some reasons why you need an AI voice changer app. As mentioned, there are many reasons to use an AI-powered voice changer as this program can unlock endless possibilities.

Below are some of the uses:

* **Privacy and security:** Assume you’re a journalist who wants to record audio about important information, but you don’t want to disclose your subject’s voice. Or, you can be a video gamer looking for the perfect AI voice that matches your video game personality.
* **Entertainment and fun:** Are your friends often pranking you with videos and audio recordings? You can score one against them by recording a prank audio or video using an AI voice changer tool.
* **Content creator:** Are you a content creator on YouTube, TikTok, Reels, and other platforms? You can use AI voice to create high-quality content with fun and engaging narrations. AI voices can also help create top-quality podcasts.
* **Accessibility:** Not everyone is blessed with a celebrity voice. It’s even more challenging to create content for those with voice challenges. But with AI voice transformers, you can convert text to audio before adding your preferred voice effect.
