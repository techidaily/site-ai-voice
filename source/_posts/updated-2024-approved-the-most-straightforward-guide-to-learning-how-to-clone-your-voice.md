So, in this post, we will help you find the best **real time AI voice changer** and some possible uses for this program. Letâ€™s dig in!

## **Part 1\. How real time AI voice changers work**

A **real time voice changer AI** is a program that has been extensively trained using deep machine learning algorithms to create a virtual clone of human voices.

Whichever model you choose, the speech training model can take a few minutes or hours to clone your voice.

But AI voice cloners donâ€™t work independently. Instead, these tools allow you to make post-processing adjustments to make your AI voice sound how you want it. For example, you can make sound adjustments like pitch, tone, emotion, etc. Overall, the AI voice cloning process is pretty complex, although the process on your side may take just a few clicks.
