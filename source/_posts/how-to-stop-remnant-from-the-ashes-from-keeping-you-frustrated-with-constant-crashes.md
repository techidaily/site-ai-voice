### Fix 1: Restart your computer

 Running multiple programs at the same time takes up a lot of resources, undermining your game performance. Apart from that, some programs may conflict with your game and cause the crashing error. So, you should close unwanted programs during gameplay by restarting your computer.

 If _Remnant_ still crashes after the reboot, go ahead with the next fix.

---

### Fix 2:**Disable your antivirus temporarily**

 The_Remnant_ crash is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If your game works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Fix 3: Run your game as an administrator

 Some players experience the_Remnant_ crash when running_Remnant_ under a standard user account. In this case, the quickest fix is granting your game launcher with admin credentials. Follow the instructions below to see how:

**1)** Exit Steam.

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image.png)

**3)**  Click the **Compatibility tab** and check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** . Then, click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1.png)

**4)**  Relaunch Steam and_Remnant_ to test your issue.

 You can hopefully run the game without errors now. If this didn’t work for you, try the fix below.

### Fix 4:**Update your graphics driver**

 Game issues, such as freezing, lagging, crashing and low FPS, are likely to occur when your graphics driver is missing or corrupted. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your issue. There are two ways to do it:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-201.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**4)** Relaunch_Remnant_ to test your issue.

If your problem persists, then move on to the next fix below.

---

### Fix 5:**Install the latest game patch**

 The developers of_Remnant_ release regular game patches to resolve bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped_Remnant_ from launching correctly, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 To check if there is any update, go to the **[Remnant site](https://www.remnantgame.com/en/about/)**  and search for the latest patch**.**  If a patch is available, install it, then run your game again to check whether the crashing problem has been fixed. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix.

If the game is still unplayable, read on and try the fix below.

### Fix 8: Run your game in compatibility mode

 This fix only applies to Windows 10 and 8\. If you’re on Window 7, check[**Fix 9**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , below.

 If Remnant crashing issues occur after Windows updates, it could be a compatibility issue. But this doesn’t necessarily mean you should play Remnant on another PC. If you’re on Windows 8 or 10, try running your game in compatibility mode. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Right-click the**Remnant icon** , then select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-214.png)

**2)**  Click the **Compatibility**  tab. Then check the box next to **Run this program in compatibility mode for** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-607.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-608.png)

**4)**  Relaunch your game to check if your issue had been resolved.

 If this didn’t work for you, repeat steps above to**disable the compatibility mode** .
