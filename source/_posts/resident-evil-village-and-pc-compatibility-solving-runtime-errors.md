### Fix 1:   **Make sure your PC meets the minimum specifications for Resident Evil Village**

 If your copy of**Resident Evil Village** crashes a lot on your PC, it’s worth gauging whether your PC is powerful enough to handle the game.

 Below I have listed the minimum (for playable performance) and recommended (for enjoyable performance) requirements for PC, and later provided the steps to check your PC specs, so that you can see for yourself how your machine is equipped.

 If your PC fails to meet any one of the following requirements, or your hardware component is showing obvious signs of wear and tear, it’s time to upgrade.

| **MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS** | **RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS**                     |                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **OPERATING SYSTEM**       | Windows 10 (64-bit)                                | Windows 10 (64-bit)                          |
| **PROCESSOR**              | Intel Core i5-7500 ／ AMD Ryzen 3 1200              | Intel Core i7-8700 ／ AMD Ryzen 5 3600        |
| **GPU**                    | Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti ／ AMD Radeon RX 560 4GB | Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 ／ AMD Radeon RX 5700 |
| **MEMORY**                 | 8GB RAM                                            | 16 GB RAM                                    |
| **STORAGE**                | 45 GB                                              | 45 GB                                        |

To check the specs of your PC:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then type **dxdiag** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dxdiag-Run-box.png)
2. Under the **System** tab and you can check the **Operating System**  and **Memory** information on your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dxdiag-diagnostic-tool-1.png)
3. Select the **Display** tab, and you’ll be presented with the information about your **graphics card** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/display-1.png)
4. Close DirectX.

### Fix 3: Disable Steam overlay

 Overlay in Steam gives you access to features and apps without having to leave the game. However, some players report that the feature has interfered with their gameplay and triggered crashing problem in RE8.

You can disable Steam overlay with the following steps:

1. Launch Steam.
2. Click**LIBRARY** , then right-click on **Resident Evil Village** and select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Resident-Evil-Village-steam-properties-1.jpg)
3. In the **GENERAL** section, uncheck the **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** box.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Disable-the-Steam-Overlay-for-Resident-Evil-Village-2.jpg)
4. Run Resident Evil Village to see if the crashing problem is fixed. If it doesn’t cut it, please try**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Run Steam as administrator

 Your game may crash if it does not have the resources required to run fully. As a fix, you can try running Steam as administrator.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **epic** , then right-click on **Steam**  and click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/123-1.png)
2. Click **Yes**  when UAC prompts for permissions to proceed.

 After that, launch Resident Evil Village game and see if the crashing problem still occurs. If it doesn’t, then great! If the issue persists, please try **Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5: Verify game integrity on Steam

 Steam client has a handy feature that allows you to verify the integrity of the game – if any files on your PC are found different to the ones on Steam servers, they’ll be changed or repaired.

The steps are pretty easy:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to **LIBRARY** , then right click on Resident Evil Village game title and click **Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Resident-Evil-Village-steam-properties-1.png)
4. Click **LOCAL FILES** \> **Verify integrity of game files…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/INTEGRITY.png)
5. Wait a few minutes for Steam to validate the files of the game. Again, any files found missing or corrupt would be automatically downloaded in the process.

6. Re-launch Resident Evil Village to see if it can be played properly. If yes, then congrats! If it’s still no joy, please try **Fix 6** , below.

### Fix 6: Close background apps

 Having too many apps running in the background at the same time may also cause your game to crash. These apps compete for CPU, memory and even induce instability issues. So it makes sense that while you’re playing the game, you close these resources hungry applications and services.

Here’s how to close background apps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** **key** , then press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** keys at the same time to bring up Task Manager.
2. Select the**Startup** tab, then right-click on each item and click**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/123.png)
3. Restart your computer.

### Fix 7: Disable HDR in RE 8 and Windows

 Resident Evil Village supports High-Dynamic Range (HDR), which is a technology used to enhance contrast and colors in graphics rendering and bring about more life-like images. This may be the case, but according to some players, it could be the cause of the crash.

 So, it’s recommended that you turn off HDR mode (both in RE8 and in Windows if your monitor supports HDR) to see if it helps with the situation.

**How to turn off HDR in Resident Evil Village** :

1. Open Steam.
2. Go to**Library** , then right-click on**Resident Evil Village** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Resident-Evil-Village-steam-properties-1.png)
3. Click**Local** \>**Browse…** .

4. Open the**Config** file and set**HDRMode-false** .

**How to turn off HDR in Windows (if your monitor supports HDR)**

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type**desk.cpl** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/desk.cpl_.png)
2. Scroll to the Windows HD Color section and turn the toggle for**Play HDR games and apps** to**Of** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/windows-hdr-off.png)

 Once you have disabled HDR, run the game in the client and see if it still crashes. If it’s still on-going, please move on to **Fix 8** .

### Fix 8: Install the latest patch

 The game crash is likely to be a bug that comes along previous updates, which requires to be patched in the next release. To check if this is the case, you can install the latest patch, then run the game again to see if the crashing problem ceases.

 If there’s no new patch available, or the problem remains after installing the latest patch, head on to **Fix 9** , below.

### Fix 9: Perform a clean boot

 Another possible cause of Resident Evil Village crashing on your PC is software conflict.

 To identify if this is the reason, you should perform a clean boot on Windows. A clean boot starts Windows with the essential programs, so that you will know if a background program is interfering with the game, or the problem lies elsewhere. If it is the former, you can repeat the steps by narrowing down to the rest half of startup items, until you isolate the offender.

Here are the steps to perform a clean boot:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to bring up the Run box. Type or past **msconfig**  and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-1.jpg)
2. Click the **Services**  tab and tick the box for **Hide all Microsoft services** .

   * **If Resident Evil Village stops crashing** , you can try repeating these steps, disabling half of the services each time until you pinpoint the culpable program.

   * **If Resident Evil Village still crashes** , please continue to **Fix 10** .

### Fix 10: **Reinstall Resident Evil Village and Steam**

 If you’ve exhausted the fixes above but the issue still sticks around, it is likley that the current version of Resident Evil Village or Steam installed on your PC is the culrpit. You should reinstall the game and the client, then check to see if you finally solve the woe.
