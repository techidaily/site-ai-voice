## Part 1: What Are Talking Stock Photos and What Can You Do With Them?

Let’s answer the most pressing question on your mind first. What are talking photos? Talking photos, simply put, are photos brought to life with video and voice. No longer are your photos just images – they can now include voice along with motion. That is one of the several uses of generative artificial intelligence that’s taking the world by storm. With talking photos, not only do you have a memory as image, but you can have the memory with voice and video to make it more life-like. In some uses, this can be deeply comforting to us.

#### 1.1: Uses of Talking Photos

What can talking photos be used for? Talking photos can be used for fun as well as for interactive education. Here are some uses of talking photos, in a gist:

* An interactive and more engaging learning experience for children.
* Convey emotions better.
* Send personalized messages with voice!
* Capture viewer attention right from the start.
* Create memories by adding voice to photos for a more vivid memory experience!
* Your social media shares can become that much more interesting and engaging.
* Presentations and financial charts and graphs could be made easier to understand.

“Okay, I’m sold on talking photos! Where can I get them?”

Glad you asked! We have collated a repository of 6 portals that offer quality talking stock photos and talking stock images that you can choose and use!

**Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

What self-respecting journalist or newsreader does not know about Getty Images? Getty has a repertoire of over 7,935,000 high-quality talking photos for you to choose from. That all but guarantees that you will be able to find the ones you want and like.

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

## Revolutionizing Communication: Real-Time AI Voice Changer

AI (Artificial Intelligence) has become part and parcel of our lives these days. Communication is one of the industries that this revolutionary technology has dramatically impacted. Nowadays, you can harness the power of AI to create professional videos and audio narrations to pass your message effectively. So, in this post, we will help you find the best **real time AI voice changer** and some possible uses for this program. Let’s dig in!

## **Part 1\. How real time AI voice changers work**

A **real time voice changer AI** is a program that has been extensively trained using deep machine learning algorithms to create a virtual clone of human voices. These programs work by creating a large data set of diverse audio clips, allowing them to analyze your live voice and transform it into your input prompt.

Usually, AI voice changers use machine learning algorithms to transform live voices recorded using your microphone easily. However, sometimes, you may need to enter a text data prompt using speech-to-text AI voice cloning services. Whichever model you choose, the speech training model can take a few minutes or hours to clone your voice.

But AI voice cloners don’t work independently. Instead, these tools allow you to make post-processing adjustments to make your AI voice sound how you want it. For example, you can make sound adjustments like pitch, tone, emotion, etc. Overall, the AI voice cloning process is pretty complex, although the process on your side may take just a few clicks.

## **Part 2\. Popular applications of real-time AI voice changers**

As said at the beginning, AI has been a vital cog in our lives for a while. Today, you can use an **AI voice changer real time** in multiple industries, including entertainment, communication, accessibility, and more. Let’s briefly overview how to use a real-time AI voice cloning app.

#### 1\. Entertainment industry

Voice changers are now widespread in the movie and gaming industries. This tool can clone your voice to sound like your favorite gaming character or celebrity. For instance, you can use voice modulation software to sound like a monster in a gaming scene and make the whole experience more immersive.

#### 2\. Communication and privacy

Using an avatar profile picture or a fake photo isn’t the only way to maintain privacy while gaming online or creating content. With a real time AI voice changer, you can clone your voice online to sound like Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Will Smith, and other celebrities. Some AI voice changers also have voices that are ideal for video documentaries.

#### 3\. Accessibility

Did you know that non-native speakers create some of the videos and audio you find online? We have AI to thank for that! This technology allows people to create unique content in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and other languages. Besides breaking language barriers, AI allows people with speech disabilities to create online content using speech-to-text converters.

AI (Artificial Intelligence) has become part and parcel of our lives these days. Communication is one of the industries that this revolutionary technology has dramatically impacted. Nowadays, you can harness the power of AI to create professional videos and audio narrations to pass your message effectively. So, in this post, we will help you find the best **real time AI voice changer** and some possible uses for this program. Let’s dig in!

## **Part 1\. How real time AI voice changers work**

A **real time voice changer AI** is a program that has been extensively trained using deep machine learning algorithms to create a virtual clone of human voices. These programs work by creating a large data set of diverse audio clips, allowing them to analyze your live voice and transform it into your input prompt.

Usually, AI voice changers use machine learning algorithms to transform live voices recorded using your microphone easily. However, sometimes, you may need to enter a text data prompt using speech-to-text AI voice cloning services. Whichever model you choose, the speech training model can take a few minutes or hours to clone your voice.

But AI voice cloners don’t work independently. Instead, these tools allow you to make post-processing adjustments to make your AI voice sound how you want it. For example, you can make sound adjustments like pitch, tone, emotion, etc. Overall, the AI voice cloning process is pretty complex, although the process on your side may take just a few clicks.

## **Part 2\. Popular applications of real-time AI voice changers**

As said at the beginning, AI has been a vital cog in our lives for a while. Today, you can use an **AI voice changer real time** in multiple industries, including entertainment, communication, accessibility, and more. Let’s briefly overview how to use a real-time AI voice cloning app.

For instance, you can use voice modulation software to sound like a monster in a gaming scene and make the whole experience more immersive.

#### 2\. Communication and privacy

Using an avatar profile picture or a fake photo isn’t the only way to maintain privacy while gaming online or creating content. With a real time AI voice changer, you can clone your voice online to sound like Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Will Smith, and other celebrities. Some AI voice changers also have voices that are ideal for video documentaries.

#### 3\. Accessibility

Did you know that non-native speakers create some of the videos and audio you find online? We have AI to thank for that! This technology allows people to create unique content in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and other languages. Besides breaking language barriers, AI allows people with speech disabilities to create online content using speech-to-text converters.

## **Part 3\. 3 popular real-time AI voice changer software**
