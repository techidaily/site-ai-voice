### 1\. Real-time voice modulator

Voicemod allows you to process voices in real-time, making it the ideal software for streaming on Twitch or making fun calls on Zoom. The AI voice generator has been extensively trained by voices from professional actors to give you human-like narrations. You only need to connect your mic to stream content with **Voicemod AI voice**. We’ll show you how to do that in this guidepost.

### 2\. Extensive variety of voice effects

Voicemod comes with more than 100 voice effects, with this voice-changing software adding more voices with new updates. The massive library of voice effects and sound modification features means you’ll get unlimited experience with Voicemod. It’s one of the few programs that allows you to modify your voices with reverb, pitch, chorus, vocoder, and other customization features.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices. With it, you can create voices from scratch by combining different audio effects and processors like reverb, pitch shifter, filter, and more. Once you have made a custom voice, proceed to name it, add an avatar, and add it to the voice control panel. This is an excellent way to create unique voices you cannot find anywhere else.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:

**Step 1\.** Install Voicemod on your Windows 7/10/11 PC or Mac computer and run it.

**![install and run voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-1.jpg)**

**Step 2\.** Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.

![enter sound settings on voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-2.jpg)

**Step 3.** Ensure that the **Voice Changer** toggle at the bottom of the Voicemod home window is enabled. Then, click the **Voicebox** tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.

**Note:** Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.

We were impressed by how easily it picks up sounds on our microphone. The range of voice effects and customization options is also impressive, to say the least. And yes, the platform itself looks stylish and modern.

But this program’s main drawback comes from its major strength. Although Voicemod is a feature-rich program, beginners might feel intimidated at first.

You can opt for the One-Time Payment at **$59.00**, although the program often has **50% off** for new installations. You can also choose the Annual plan of **$23.88** or the 3-month plan of **$11.97**.

Below are some of the advantages you’ll get with Voicemod Pro:

* Design your unique voices from scratch with VoiceLab.
