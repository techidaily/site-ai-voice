The term "voice quality" pertains to the overall sound and clarity of the vocals produced. In the case of **AI rap voice generators**, the voices produced should sound authentic. A good quality voice should imitate the sound of real people, enabling the listener to connect with the emotions and feelings conveyed through the words. To convey the artist's message effectively, vocals must be clear and understandable, with minimal artificial or robotic characteristics, to maintain its authenticity.

### 02 Customization Options

Customization options connect to the various parameters and features that artists may change to mold the created voices to their preferences. These alternatives could entail altering the word's tone and pitch in addition to their pronunciation.

The ability to customize vocals gives musicians a chance to match the generated voices to their aesthetics, musical goals, and the atmosphere of the music they are creating. This level of personalization allows the produced sound to become a crucial part of the artist's identity and artistic expression.

### 03 Rhythm and Flow

Rap music depends significantly on rhythm and flow. The timing, speed, and delivery of the vocals play crucial roles in defining the artist's distinctive style. A decent **AI voice rapper** should include capabilities that sync the produced sounds with the rhythm and allow for precise control over the pace and flow of the words.

A seamless and engrossing musical experience is created by ensuring that the generated vocals and the instruments seamlessly integrate. When performers have control over the rhythm and flow, they are given the means to provide engaging performances that engage audiences.

The massive library of voice effects and sound modification features means you’ll get unlimited experience with Voicemod. It’s one of the few programs that allows you to modify your voices with reverb, pitch, chorus, vocoder, and other customization features.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices. With it, you can create voices from scratch by combining different audio effects and processors like reverb, pitch shifter, filter, and more. Once you have made a custom voice, proceed to name it, add an avatar, and add it to the voice control panel. This is an excellent way to create unique voices you cannot find anywhere else.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:

**Step 1\.** Install Voicemod on your Windows 7/10/11 PC or Mac computer and run it.

**![install and run voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-1.jpg)**

**Step 2\.** Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.

**Step 3.** Ensure that the **Voice Changer** toggle at the bottom of the Voicemod home window is enabled. Then, click the **Voicebox** tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.

**Step 4.** If the voice is working, head to the application or browser tab where you want to apply the voice effect to start streaming. That’s it!

**Note:** Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.

## Part III. Real User Experience

So, what was our user experience with **AI Voicemod**? To be honest, Voicemod is one of the best if not the best, voice modulator programs. We were impressed by how easily it picks up sounds on our microphone. The range of voice effects and customization options is also impressive, to say the least. And yes, the platform itself looks stylish and modern.

But this program’s main drawback comes from its major strength. Although Voicemod is a feature-rich program, beginners might feel intimidated at first. You may need to follow the developer’s guide to connect your microphone appropriately and customize the sound settings. Overall, Voicemod isn’t for green hands, although it’s fun to use once you get the hang of it.

## Part IV. Pricing and Plans

Although Voicemod is free, you must upgrade to the Pro version to unlock all the voice effects and capabilities. Thankfully, the Voicemod subscription plan is one of the most competitive. You can opt for the One-Time Payment at **$59.00**, although the program often has **50% off** for new installations. You can also choose the Annual plan of **$23.88** or the 3-month plan of **$11.97**.

Below are some of the advantages you’ll get with Voicemod Pro:

* Design your unique voices from scratch with VoiceLab.
* Unlimited MP3 and WAV audio uploads.
* Complete Voicebox with 80+ pre-made voice effects.
* Receive new voices and themed soundboards every month.
