<p><strong><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="install and run voicemod ai"
                ></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="enter sound settings on voicemod ai"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Ensure that the <strong>Voice Changer</strong> toggle at the bottom of the Voicemod home window is enabled. Then, click the <strong>Voicebox</strong> tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.</p>
